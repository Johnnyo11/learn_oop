# Theme of project
Probably start with something useful. Let's go with a student's Education Management System.
It tracks and keeps data related to studies and plans and so on.

Current main goal:
1) Serve students as a system that track their modules/subjects and their grade.
2) If possible, track deadlines.
3) Calculates the days for reminder of duration of semester.
4) If needed, serves as a palce for journal for user.
5) Optional: connect the system to an API or something, idk how to do that.

Maybe I'll add other projects that connects to this (future plan)
